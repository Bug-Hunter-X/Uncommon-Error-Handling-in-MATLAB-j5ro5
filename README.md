This repository demonstrates an uncommon error handling scenario in MATLAB. The code in 'bug.m' showcases a function that throws an error if the input is negative.  The solution, 'bugSolution.m', illustrates a more robust approach to handling this error using try-catch blocks.  This example highlights the importance of proper error handling for creating more reliable and user-friendly MATLAB programs.
